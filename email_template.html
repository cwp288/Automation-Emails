    <p>Dear {{PERSON_NAME}},</p>
    <p>I hope this email finds you well! My name is Cullen Pek, and I am a current student at Rutgers University, majoring in Computer Science (B.S). with a minor in Data Science.<br>
     I am reaching out to express my interest in internship opportunities within {{COMPANY_NAME}}, particularly in the field of Software Engineering and Data Science.</p>

    <p>My interest in this field began when I developed an <b>Automated Job Application Tracker</b>, where I applied object-oriented programming and data structures to manage and organize job applications efficiently. <br>
        Through this project, I implemented a priority system to categorize applications based on urgency, application date, job title, company, and status. Additionally, I integrated an automation system that scans<br>
        emails to update an SQL database with the latest application status. I also enabled the automated removal of denied applications and the generation of organized reports in Excel.</p>

    <p>I have been able to perfect my strong problem-solving and leadership skills as a <b>STEM Leader at YMCA Camp Wiggi.</b> Through this opportunity, I was able to hone my <br>
        problem-solving skills by organizing and managing diverse activities, ensuring everything ran smoothly and efficiently. I also developed strong conflict resolution abilities <br>
        by maintaining a positive environment and addressing challenges as they arose. Additionally, I emphasized cohesive communication with parents through keeping them informed and <br>
        addressing any concerns. My frequent communication with parents reinforced my ability to convey important information effectively. <br>
